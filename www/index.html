			<p>It is approximately 2 miles but can take up to 1.5 hours because of all the points of interest to view en route.  
			Underfoot is virtually all tarmac or cobbles so hopefully muddy feet can be avoided. 
			Unfortunately, the walk has some steep slopes and is not recommended for wheelchairs.</p>

            <p>When it was a single dwelling, the entire mansion was called Sapling Grove and was the residence of 
			Wainhouse's uncle Robert, who owned a large Dye house (now a small industrial estate) just below the mansion 
			and further west.</p>
			<p>Wainhouse (and his two sisters) moved here to live with their uncle when their mother died in 1829 when Wainhouse 
			was just 12 years old. </p>
	        <p>It is not known what role, if any, Wainhouse had with his uncle's Dye house, but he inherited the entire works 
			and many more properties locally in 1856, aged 39, when his uncle passed away. 
			His sisters also benefited from the death of their uncle, but Wainhouse bought their shares of works and 
			property for &pound;20,000 each. </p>
			<p>What we do know is that he let the Works Manager, Henry Mossman, run the company and had little to do with it himself.  
			Later, in 1870, he leased the works to Mossman, finally selling it to him in 1873, and Mossman moved into Sapling Grove 
			as that was part of the sale too.</p>
			<p>Sapling Grove today is just half of the original mansion and cannot be seen on our walk. </p>

			<p>He didn't move here immediately upon vacating Sapling Grove but lived for a while at another house, 
			now 37-39 Delph Hill Terrace, Halifax, HX2 7EJ, but then called Delville.</p>
			<p>West Air has many unusual features including two mottos carved into the stonework; "Crede Coleri" = "Believe in Colour" 
			(reference to dye working) and "Parcere subjectis et deballere superbos" = "Spare the lowly and make war on the proud" 
			(rumoured to be reference to his dislike and feud with Sir Henry Edwards, his next-door neighbour).

			was demolished.  
			It now sits within the estate of his archenemy Sir Henry Edwards (hence Edwards Road).</p>
			<p>It is odd that Wainhouse built his new house right next to the boundary of the two estates. 
			He and Edwards rowed over wells and watercourses that ran through their estates and all over this hillside.  
			Wainhouse even had a number of pamphlets published and distributed at his own expense lampooning Edwards.</p>

            <p>Finally, we reach the tower.
			Begun in 1871, it was for use by the dye works, 350 metres further down the hillside, with a planned underground 
			tunnel to take smoke away from the valley.</p>
			<p>Its construction  (a common solution in its day) was forced to some degree, as many factories were then being 
			prosecuted under the new Smoke Abatement Act.</p>
			<p>In 1874, when Wainhouse sold the dye works to Henry Mossman, Henry Mossman declined to buy the then nearly 
			completed chimney as he didn't want responsibility for it.</p>
			<p>It is commonly thought that the chimney was abandoned for use as such and then clad in stone with the inclusion 
			of a spiral staircase to the top (403 steps), but this is not true as it was always planned and built to have 
			this stone cladding and the staircase.</p>
			<p>Complaints persisted against Henry Mossman for smoke pollution (from Sir Henry Edwards for one) but he successfully 
			defended a prosecution by installing fans and building a new chimney on the dye works' premises without the need 
			to make use of the Tower chimney.</p>
			<p>The elaborate top was redesigned and, being accessible by the staircase, is sometimes referred to as the Observatory.  
			There is a local tale told that Wainhouse did this out of spite to be able to look into the estate of his hated 
			neighbour Sir Henry Edwards, who had built a wall around to stop people doing just that.  
			There may be some truth here? Notice that, as at West Air, all the windows in the tower are of different designs.</p>

        <tr> 
          <th> 
            <p>On the lower side of the base is a blocked up archway, which was intended for the flue to enter.  
			The tower is 253 feet high, eight sided, and was finished on 9 September 1875 requiring 9000 tons of stone to 
			construct at a cost of about &pound;14000 when wages were &pound;1 per week. 
			The inner chimney is simply made of brick. Very little mortar was used in the construction as Wainhouse 
			preferred a dowelling technique with copper pins, as in all his other buildings such as West Air.</p>
			<p>Following the death of Wainhouse, it had a number of private owners until the local council acquired it 
			following a public subscription, on 30 May 1919.</p>
			<p>The Tower is open for the public to ascend, for a small charge, on Bank holidays and selected dates through the 
			year - contact Calderdale council or Visitor Information Centre for details. 
			Wainhouse, himself, used to allow local clubs and churches to use the tower for a day or so in order that they 
			profit from allowing visitors to ascend.</p>
			<p>Leaving the Tower, we head to Skircoat Moor Road. There are 3 ways to get there from the Tower, 
			two dirt-like paths leading from the grassy area at the foot of the tower (both of which can be very muddy after rain) 
			or the recommendation is to retrace your steps to Wakefield Gate and continue up the steep cobbled road.</p>

			<p>The homes were for married couples aged over 60, and ex-employees of Mackintosh, and members of the congregation 
			of Queens Road United Methodist Church, who had a joint income of between &pound;1 and &pound;2 per week.

			as a recreation ground and to be called the Savile Park. 
			The council planned to turn it into a park.</p>
			<p>However, the council still didn't have control over the land as 
			the Skircoat Board of Surveyors held 'rights' over the land although they didn't own it. 
			Our John Edward Wainhouse was not only a member of the Board but performed the negotiations with the council 
			to sell their 'rights'.  He asked for &pound;12,000 which was an absurd amount - they offered &pound;200 - and he eventually 
			settled for &pound;201 but with an agreement that no park be built and that it be left unenclosed in perpetuity.</p>
